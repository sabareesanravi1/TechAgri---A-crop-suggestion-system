# TechAgri---A-crop-suggestion-system
To enhance the crop production in india, the best crop for the soil need to be selected. we have made a crop suggestion system that provides the top 3 suitable crops for the respective district in each state in india.

I have utilised the government official dataset for the suggestion model

I used pandas for the data mining and extracted the best crop for the respective district in each state by highest mean method of the production of crops in each year

You can directly upload the csv into mongodb and run the application by running the app.py
